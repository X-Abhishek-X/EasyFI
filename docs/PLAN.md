# EasyFI — Build Plan (loop goal)

Spec: `docs/specs/2026-10-22-easyfi-design.md`. Research: `docs/research/simplifi/`.

## Loop protocol

Each iteration:
1. Pick the **first unchecked** task below.
2. Write failing test(s) first, then implement until green.
3. Run `pnpm verify` (lint + typecheck + test + build). Fix until it passes.
4. Tick the box (`- [x]`), add a one-line note if something non-obvious happened.
5. Commit with a conventional message (`feat(core): ...`).
6. If blocked (missing secret, external decision), write it under **Blocked** and move to the next task.

Stop when every box is ticked or only blocked tasks remain.

## M0 — Scaffold
- [x] pnpm + Turborepo monorepo with `apps/web` and packages listed in spec §4; TS strict; shared tsconfig/eslint/prettier
  - Note: TypeScript pinned to 5.9.3 and ESLint to 9.x — typescript-eslint does not support TS 7, eslint-plugin-import/react not yet on ESLint 10. Packages are source-only (exports `./src/index.ts`, transpiled by Next).
- [x] Vitest configured per package; `pnpm verify` script at root
- [x] ESLint boundary rules enforcing spec §4 dependency rule (test: a forbidden import fails lint)
  - Note: uses built-in `no-restricted-imports` per directory (`boundaryRules()` in root config); test in `tooling/boundaries.test.ts`.
- [x] GitHub Actions CI running `pnpm verify`
- [x] `.env.example` listing every env var (Supabase URL/keys, DATABASE_URL, TIINGO_TOKEN, SEC_USER_AGENT, BLS_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_MODEL, INVITE_CODES)

## M1 — Core domain (pure, fixtures)
- [x] `test-fixtures`: VOO, QQQ, SCHD, VGT, VTI holdings (top ~50 each + realistic sectors), prices, dividends
- [x] `normalizeTicker`
- [x] `lookThrough` + per-source breakdown + unresolved slice
- [x] `foldBy` (company/sector/industry/asset)
- [x] `concentration` + `diversificationScore`
- [x] `overlap`
- [x] `exposureInsights`
- [x] `constellationGraph`
- [x] `portfolioValueSeries`
- [x] `dividendSummary` (TTM, yield, YoC, next 30d, projection, frequency)
- [x] `purchasingPower` (+ `cpiSnapshot`, `fiProgress`, `parseMoney`)
- [x] `parseBrokerCsv` (generic + Fidelity + Schwab + Vanguard)
- [x] `whatIf`, `feeDrag`

## M2 — Database, auth, API foundation
- [x] Drizzle schema per spec §5 + migrations; RLS-enabled-no-policies migration
  - Note: no DATABASE_URL → embedded PGlite (`.easyfi-data/`) for local demo mode.
- [x] PGlite test harness (fresh migrated DB per test file)
- [x] Repositories with user scoping (test: user A cannot read user B's portfolio)
- [x] `contracts` zod schemas + OpenAPI generation at `/api/v1/openapi.json`
  - Note: M2 endpoints only (me, portfolios, holdings, import); later milestones add their schemas. Request bodies use `z.strictObject` so unknown fields 400. Stale `apps/web/.next/types` from an earlier build can fail typecheck locally — delete `.next`.
- [x] Auth middleware: Supabase JWT (Bearer) + SSR cookie; invite-code sign-up gate
  - Note: `services/auth.ts` (Bearer/chunked `sb-*-auth-token` cookie, HS256 secret or Supabase JWKS), `config.ts` (demo mode only outside production; prod without Supabase env throws), `POST /api/v1/auth/sign-up` creates users via the Supabase admin API (`SupabaseAuthAdmin`) so the invite check cannot be bypassed from the browser. `db/migrate.ts` joins the drizzle path at runtime — Turbopack failed on the literal URL.
- [x] Error envelope + zod validation helper
  - Note: `services/http.ts`: `route()` wrapper, `parseBody/parseParams/parseQuery`. Bad route ids return 404 (not 400) so ids cannot be probed; unexpected errors are logged and returned as a generic 500.
- [x] Endpoints: `/me`, portfolios CRUD, holdings CRUD, CSV import
  - Note: `services/me.ts`, `services/portfolios.ts` + `authedRoute()`; foreign ids are 404. CSV cash/money-market rows add to the portfolio cash balance; value-only lines store shares=0 + statementValue (shares is NOT NULL).
- [x] Generated typed client package used by web
  - Note: lives in `@easyfi/contracts/client` (openapi-typescript → `schema.gen.ts` + openapi-fetch `createApiClient`). Regenerate with `pnpm --filter @easyfi/contracts gen:client`; a file-snapshot test fails CI when it drifts. Web: `src/lib/api.ts`.

## M3 — Data ingestion
- [x] `data-sources` interfaces + fakes: PriceSource, HoldingsSource, DividendSource, CpiSource, LLMProvider
- [x] Tiingo client (EOD, dividends, IEX last) with recorded fixtures
- [x] SEC EDGAR N-PORT client: ticker→series lookup, parse holdings XML, map CUSIP→ticker
  - Note: UIT funds (SPY, QQQ, DIA) don't file N-PORT → need seeded holdings.
- [x] BLS CPI client
- [x] Securities search + seed of popular ETFs
  - Note: `services/catalog.ts` (50 popular US ETFs, names only — expense ratios left null until a verified source fills them; seeded on app start, never overwrites). `GET /securities/search` + `/securities/{ticker}`. `data-sources/sec/company-tickers.ts` parses SEC company_tickers.json (~10k stocks) for the nightly job.
- [x] Nightly job (spec §9) + `job_runs` table + GitHub Actions cron workflow
  - Note: `services/nightly.ts` (incremental prices/dividends from last stored date, N-PORT refresh only when newer, CPI only when a new month exists, prune >2y; per-ticker failures → `partial`), entry `packages/jobs/src/nightly.ts` via tsx, `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` (needs repo secrets DATABASE_URL, TIINGO_TOKEN, SEC_USER_AGENT, BLS_KEY; fails in CI without DATABASE_URL).
  - Real run 2026-10-22 (SEC+BLS, no Tiingo token): 47/50 catalog ETFs with holdings (SPY/DIA are UITs; SPLG not in SEC fund list), 10,426 stocks, 181 CPI points, 1m13s.
  - SEC client now looks a filing up by series id first (iShares/SPDR/Invesco trusts were beyond the 40-filing scan). Constituent tickers resolved by exact normalised issuer name vs SEC company list (`core/resolveConstituentTickers`), equity lines only: VOO 95.8%, SCHD 99.3%, VT 71.6% (non-US unresolved), AGG 0% (bonds). 25/25 random matches checked correct.

## M10 — Deploy
- [ ] Vercel project + env vars documented in `docs/DEPLOY.md`
- [ ] Supabase project setup steps + migration command documented
- [ ] Smoke test on production URL

## Blocked
- Rate limiting for `POST /auth/sign-up` (invite brute force; review finding 2026-10-22). Needs a decision: DB-backed counter table (free tier) vs Vercel/Upstash. Unblocks when the storage choice is made.
